## Plan on improving the project

To improve the project, I would create a link on each menu item where prospective customer can visually view the item and preorder it so that they can pick up in store. That way the coffee shop sales are increased due to the convenience of ordering.

Also, I would change the blue color in certain lettering and background to be more orange or brown as these colors represent warmth, vibrant and playful. This would be better than the color blue which can be found mostly industries such as healthcare and banks.

Furthermore, I would add more videos to the recipe section in a way that is not overwhelming. I would do this by displaying the most recent video added.

Laslty, I would add a review section from other students and customers about the coffeeshop. This would create trust in prospective customers and the target customer base:university study, tends to look at online reviews very much.
